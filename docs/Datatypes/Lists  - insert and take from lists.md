Inserting and taking from lists

- inserting into a list at a given position:
	- list.insert(position, element)  https://thispointer.com/python-how-to-insert-an-element-at-specific-index-in-list/
- inserting at the end of a list:
	- list = list+[]
	- or list.extend([1,2,3,4]) // extend adds each element as a new element to the list, whereas append just adds one element (the new one) to the list
	- list.append([1,2,3,4]) // inserts the argument **as one element** at the end of the list



Drop from list
list.remove()
